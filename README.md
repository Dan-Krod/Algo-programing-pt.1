## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains the full set of Python laboratory assignments for the academic course "Algorithmic and Programming Basics Part 1". It covers seven labs, gradually introducing key programming concepts — from environment setup and scripting fundamentals, to object-oriented programming, testing, and exception handling with decorators.

Assignments follow Variant №6 and were completed as part of coursework at **Lviv Polytechnic National University** (2023–2024).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- `requests`, `math`, `logging`
- `pytest`, `pylint`
- Git + Markdown for documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone ....
   ```

2. Navigate to a lab folder:
   ```bash
   cd code/lab_3/
   ```

3. Run a script using Python:
   ```bash
   python variant_1.py
   ```

4. View the corresponding assignment in `docs/` for task details.

## 📎 Notes

All scripts are named and structured according to assignment instructions. Each lab is self-contained and uses readable, documented code. Additional lab extensions like decorators, unit tests, and exception handling are included in later labs.
